  <h3>404 Page Not Found</h3>
  <h4>The page you were looking for could not be found.</h4>
  <p>Sorry, this URL doesn't exist. Or it has existed but is not available anymore (which is highly probable).
     Or in your dreams, maybe ?
     Anyway, please <a href="/">head back home</a> to find what you are looking for!</p>

  NB: I recently moved to github.io early 2019, so there might be some links that broke during this. If you feel that it is the reason you are reading this right now, feel free to drop a mail.
