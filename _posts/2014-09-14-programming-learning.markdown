> Let's code together !

ProgrammingLearning is a new project to help people getting started with programming.
Since I am learning C and C++, I figured out that I could take my C# practical
session from first year and apply them to each languages to get the basis. That
gave me the idea to create an exercise sheet for anybody who would like to learn
a new language and train himself. I will create corrections for languages I know
or I want to learn: by doing this I practice my own languages and I can provide
some basis to new programmers !


Languages available can be found [there][languages].

The project itself is hosted on [Github][github].

Anybody can help by providing corrections for languages that are not already
available, or by reporting any mistake that I could have made.

Feedback is always greatly appreciated!
