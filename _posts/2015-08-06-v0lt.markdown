> v0lt is an attempt to regroup every tool I used/use/will use in security CTF, Python style.

A lot of exercises were solved using bash scripts but Python may be more flexible, that's why. Nothing to do with Gallopsled. It's a toy toolkit, with small but specific utils only.

A lot of it has been taken from real exploits I used in CTF, and thus they have officially been tested.
You can check it on its [Github repo][repo].

#### Demo: Shellcode
{% highlight ruby %}
>>> from v0lt import *
>>> shellhack = ShellHack(4096, "bin","execve")
>>> shellhack.get_shellcodes(shellhack.keywords)
