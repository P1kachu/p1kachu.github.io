(Last updated on: 2025/12/15)

I'm Stanislas Lejay, a computer science engineer from France specialized in
reverse engineering, and security in general.

I used to take part in security events like CTFs with my team from the
[LSE](http://www.lse.epita.fr).
I then work(ed) for:
- [WhiteMotion (Japan)](http://www.white-motion.com/) for 3 years as a security and automotive researcher.
- [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com/jp/) for 2 years as a Managing Security Consultant.
- [Trenchant](https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/trenchant) since 2023 as a Senior Security Researcher.

I like computer security and anything related to automotive.
